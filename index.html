        <img src="abtschool.jpg">
        <p>The school is primarily known as a driving school for boats under the sea, owned by Mrs. Puff and being the place of work of multiple other teachers. However, in the depths of Bikini Bottom, this school also acts functionally as a grade school, with recess and hall monitors being an integral part to maintaining the sanctity of the curriculum. One of our most notable alumni is Spongebob Squarepants, a admirable graduate who was able to make it through our rigorous driving tests.</p>
